## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m an Informatics student at *Universitas Teknokrat Indonesia* with a strong interest in **Linux systems**, **cybersecurity**, and **web development**.

I enjoy working with Linux-based environments, exploring system-level tools, and building small projects to automate everyday tasks. I also like experimenting with network analysis tools and learning how systems communicate and behave in real scenarios.

My current focus areas include:

- Linux system administration & scripting  
- Network and cybersecurity fundamentals  
- Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
- Building practical skills through hands-on learning  

I’m passionate about technology, eager to grow, and always open to learning something new — whether through self-exploration, collaboration, or contributing to open-source communities.

> *Curious mind. Consistent effort. Always learning.*
